# CodePush on Cloudflare Workers üöÄ

![main branch test status](https://github.com/ssut/code-push-cloudflare-workers/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

A community-driven port of Microsoft's [CodePush Standalone](https://github.com/microsoft/code-push-server), designed for cost-effective and scalable over-the-air updates using Cloudflare Workers.

**No Servers Needed!** You can now use CodePush Standalone without managing any infrastructure, **nor needing an understanding of it!**

**Status: Alpha - Under Development üß™** - Core functionality is **100% compatible ‚úÖ** with the official CodePush, but further testing and improvements are ongoing.

**Important Note:** This project is not affiliated with, maintained, or endorsed by Microsoft or the CodePush team. It's a community initiative aimed at providing a more accessible and affordable alternative.

## Why I Built This

This project addresses a crucial need for a reliable and cost-effective solution following Microsoft's planned shutdown of AppCenter CodePush in March 2025.

The official CodePush Standalone server:
   - Is not readily deployable as a true *standalone* solution.
   - Requires a complex setup with Azure infrastructure.
   - Has a difficult-to-maintain codebase with a less-than-ideal TypeScript implementation.

This project provides **a seamless, drop-in replacement üîå** using Cloudflare Workers, resolving these issues.

## Cost Comparison (vs Azure Deployment)

This project significantly reduces operational costs by utilizing Cloudflare's infrastructure. Here's a detailed breakdown of the estimated monthly costs:

| Service                  | Azure (Original)         | Cloudflare Workers (This Project)  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Compute**             |                          |                                   |
| Azure App Service       | $13.14 (Basic B1)         | $0 (Free Tier Handles 3M Requests)  |
| **Caching**             |                          |                                  |
| Azure Cache for Redis   | $16.43 (Basic C0)         | $0 (Using Cloudflare D1 as a cache, this is fast enough)    |
| **Storage**            |                          |                                   |
| Azure Blob Storage      | ~$2.88 (min usage, incl Queue & Table) | $0 (10GB Free, 1M Class A/10M Class B with R2)  |
| Azure Key Vault    |$0.03 (10,000 operations)| $0 (integrated on R2)  |
| **Total Estimated**      | **~$32.48**               | **$0** (Free Tier)                |

Traditional deployments of the official CodePush Standalone on Azure require *an estimated ~$32.48 per month*, while this project can handle up to 1 million monthly API requests entirely for *free* within Cloudflare's generous free tier and using it's R2 storage and D1 database.

**Note:** Network bandwidth cost is not included in the comparison. By using Cloudflare's infrastructure, network bandwidth cost is almost free for most use cases.

## Key Benefits

*   ‚ú® **Global, Serverless, Effortless:** Deliver updates globally with low latency, powered by Cloudflare's edge network, all without managing any servers.
*   ‚òÅÔ∏è **Integrated Cloudflare Infrastructure:**  Utilizes Cloudflare's D1 (SQLite-compatible) for data and R2 (S3-compatible) for package storage, eliminating the need for external services.
*   üí∞ **Cost-Efficient:** Operates within Cloudflare's cost-optimized serverless environment, minimizing operational overhead.
*   üöÄ **Simple Deployment:** Deploy directly to Cloudflare Workers with a streamlined process.
*   ‚úÖ **100% API Compatible:** Functions seamlessly with existing applications using the official CodePush API.

## Features

-   ‚öôÔ∏è **Fully Compatible API**: Implements the complete CodePush API.
-   üíæ **Cloudflare Storage**: Leverages D1 (SQLite) and R2 (S3) for data and package storage.
-   üåê **Edge Delivery**: Utilizes Cloudflare's edge network for fast updates.
-   ‚ö°Ô∏è **Seamless Deployment:** Deploy your CodePush server to Cloudflare Workers with a streamlined and simplified process, reducing the setup time and effort

## Implementation Status (Test Passes)

### Web

To be implemented.

### CLI

While [the official CodePush Standalone CLI](https://github.com/microsoft/code-push-server/blob/main/cli/README.md) can be used, a custom CLI is planned for far future releases.

## Getting Started

**Base Guide:**
 - `apps/server`: CodePush Standalone Server (Cloudflare Workers)
 - `apps/web`: Admin UI for managing apps, deployments, and releases (optional, Cloudflare Pages)

**Note:** Detailed instructions and commands for each step are **TBD** and will be added soon. Here's a high-level overview:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/code-push-cloudflare-workers.git
    cd code-push-cloudflare-workers
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    corepack enable
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Configure Cloudflare:**
    -   Install the `wrangler` CLI.
    -   Authenticate with your Cloudflare account.
    -   Create a D1 database and an R2 bucket.
    -   Update `wrangler.toml` with your Cloudflare credentials and other environment variables in the `apps/server` directory.
4.  **Apply Database Migrations:**

    ```bash
    cd apps/server
    pnpm apply
    ```
     or for production enviroment
    ```bash
